# Portfolio Website

Static portfolio scaffold with sections for hero, about, projects, skills, and contact.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Semantic layout with anchors for each section.
- `styles.css` – Global styles, layout, and responsive tweaks.
- `script.js` – Lightweight nav interactions and active-section highlighting.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step or dependencies are required.

## Customizing
- Replace placeholder copy (name, bio, project blurbs) in `index.html`.
- Update colors or typography in the CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- Wire project/contact links to real destinations when ready.
