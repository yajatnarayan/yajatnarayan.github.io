          Back in 2020, I started teaching coding to K-12 students during the pandemic and tumbled down the rabbit hole of

          Most recently, I built VR training modules for a $15M Air Force contract at Holos.io using Unity and Apple Vision Pro,

          procedures or protecting user data with privacy-focused applications.
